**THE PROJECT WAS CREATED DURING MY STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND**


**Introduction**

In this project, I completed the frontend and backend of a web application to display data about Pokemon. The web application's backend maintains its own list of Pokemon info in a JSON file, as well as enables users to import data about additional Pokemon from the PokeAPI RESTful API service.

**Project structure**

The project directory contains the following:

**public**: Publically accessible contents.

**css**: Contains a site CSS file.

**js**: Contains a client.js file for the client-side JavaScript code.

**src**: Server-side JavaScript code - a Node.js application.

**db**: Contains code for reading and writing the Pokemon JSON file.

**json**: Contains the Pokemon JSON file used as a "database" (pokemon.json), as well as an umodified copy (pokemon-FRESH.json) which can be used as a backup in case the main JSON file gets corrupted.

**routes**: Contains the routes of the Node.js application.

**index.js**: Main Node.js application entry point.

**views**: Handlebars templates.
